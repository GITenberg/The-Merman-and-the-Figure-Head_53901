<p class="t0">&ldquo;I may be wrong, but I think it a pity</p>
<p class="t0">For a movable doll to be made so pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr"><i>Doll Poems.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall call her the Sea-nymph,&rdquo; said
Master Isaac Torrey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; said his clerk, Ichabod
Sterns, looking over his spectacles at his master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not The Sea-nymph, pray?&rdquo; demanded
Master Torrey. &ldquo;Why, I say, should I
not call my fine new brig The Sea-nymph if it
pleases my fancy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy!&rdquo; said Ichabod Sterns, putting his
head on one side. &ldquo;Fancy! Umph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now this was most exasperating conduct on
Ichabod&rsquo;s part, and as such Master Torrey felt
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if it pleases my fancy,&rdquo; he repeated, defiantly.
&ldquo;What right have you, Ichabod Sterns,
to object to that, I should like to know? If I
chose to name her after the whole choir of all the
nymphs that ever swam in the sea&mdash;Panope and
Melite, Arethusa, Leucothea, Thetis, Cymodoce&mdash;what
have you to say against it? Isn&rsquo;t she to
swim the seas and make her living out of the winds
and waves? And what can you object to &lsquo;The
Sea-nymph?&rsquo; I&rsquo;d like to hear. But it&rsquo;s your nature
to object, Ichabod Sterns. I&rsquo;ve no doubt
that you came objecting into the world, and I&rsquo;ve
no doubt that when your time comes you&rsquo;ll object
to dying. It would be just like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And death will mind my objections no more
than you, Master Torrey,&rdquo; said the old clerk,
smiling rather grimly as Master Torrey ceased his
pacing up and down the room and flung himself
into a chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what <i>is</i> your objection to the name?&rdquo;
asked the merchant, calming down a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I object?&rdquo; said Ichabod Sterns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you? You were bristling all over
with objections from the toe of your shoe to the
top of your wig.&rdquo; Ichabod involuntarily put up
his hand to his wig. &ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t it a good name
for a ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, I know naught against it, Master Torrey,
only it is a heathenish kind of name for a
ship that is to sail out of our decent Christian
town of Salem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heathenish! Let me tell you, Master Ichabod,
that this world owes a vast deal to the heathen&mdash;more
than she does to some Christians I
could name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now this awful speech was enough to make the
very pig tails of many of Master Torrey&rsquo;s acquaintance
stand on end with horror and surprise. But
Ichabod was used to his master&rsquo;s ways, so he did
not jump out of his chair, but only looked to the
door to be sure that no one had overheard the terrible
statement, for had such been the case there
is no telling what might have come to pass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you make that out, Master Torrey?&rdquo;
he said, composedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever happen to hear of Socrates or
Cicero?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Ichabod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you ever hear of the Duke of Alva,
or Cardinal Pole, or Bloody Queen Mary, or
Catenat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; returned Ichabod
again, a little fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And which was the better man, the Athenian
or the Christians who burnt their fellows at the
stake?&rdquo; said Master Torrey, triumphantly, as one
who had made a point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; said Ichabod; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a scholar
like you, Master Torrey, but I&rsquo;d like you to tell
me whether they were Christians by name that
poisoned Socrates and murdered Cicero?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; said the merchant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; said Ichabod Sterns again, leaning
back on his chair and rubbing his hands slowly
one over the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what of that?&rdquo; said Master Torrey, a
little taken aback.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing, sir,&rdquo; said Ichabod; &ldquo;we have
wandered a long way from the name of the new
brig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shall be The Sea-nymph,&rdquo; said Master
Torrey with decision. &ldquo;What could be better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought, Master Torrey, you might have
liked to call her the Anna Jane,&rdquo; said Ichabod,
with a little cracked laugh like an amused
crow.</p>
<p>Master Torrey colored high, but not with displeasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t venture, Ichabod, I wouldn&rsquo;t dare.
She&rsquo;s too shy, too modest, to be pleased with such
an open compliment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; said the clerk again. It seemed to
be a way he had. &ldquo;But you are determined to
call her The Sea-nymph, Master Torrey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, am I!&rdquo; replied Torrey, who seemed by
no means disposed to pursue the subject of the
&ldquo;inexpressive she,&rdquo; whoever it might be. &ldquo;And
she shall have the handsomest figure-head that Job
Chippit can carve; and it sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be a mere head
and shoulders either, it shall be a full-length
figure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will cost a good penny, master. Job&rsquo;s
prices are high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another objection! Who cares what
it costs? Am I a destitute person? Am I an absolute
pauper? Am I like to apply to the selectmen
to be supported by the town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, master,&rdquo; said Ichabod, gathering his
papers together. &ldquo;But if we go to following our
<i>fancies</i>&rdquo;&mdash;scornful emphasis&mdash;&ldquo;there is no telling
where we may end;&rdquo; and without giving his master
time to reply, Ichabod sped out of the counting-room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Now I am not going to tell you a long story
about Master Torrey, though I might do so if I
had not a tale to tell you about something else&mdash;namely,
this sea-nymph and the merman who
figure at the head of this story. I was once told
by a schoolmaster that in writing there was &ldquo;nothing
so important as a strict adherence to facts;&rdquo;
&ldquo;fax&rdquo; he called them. I treasured up this valuable
precept in the inmost recesses of my mind,
and I mean to adhere to facts if I possibly can.
But I can&rsquo;t adhere to facts till I get them, and to
do that I don&rsquo;t see but I shall have to tell you a
little about Master Isaac Torrey, merchant of
Salem, who was the means of putting this wonderful
figure-head in the merman&rsquo;s way. He was a
merchant of Salem when Salem was a centre of
trade, and sent many a brave ship to the Indies
and the Mediterranean. He was thirty-four years
old, and looked ten years younger. He was a
man inclined to extravagance and luxury. He
wore the handsomest waistcoats and the finest lace
of any one in town. He had been educated in
the gravest, strictest fashion of those grave days.
His parents would have been horrified if they had
found him reading a novel or a play, but they
urged him on to study Virgil and Homer.</p>
<p>Now if you will promise, my young readers,
never to tell your respected instructors, I will let
you into a secret. The truth is that the poems of
Virgil and Homer are all full of stories as interesting
and charming as any boy or girl could desire.
But this is a circumstance which most school-teachers
make it their first object in life to conceal,
and they generally succeed so well that their
pupils for the most part go through their whole
course of education and never discover that their
Virgils and Homers are anything but stupid school-books&mdash;a
sort of intellectual catacombs enshrining
the dryest bones of grammar and parsing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Now and then, however, a boy or girl finds out
that there is food for the imagination in classic
poetry. Such had been the case with Isaac Torrey,
and the verses that he read with his tutor
took such a hold upon him that he became what
some of his friends called &ldquo;half a heathen.&rdquo; Not
but that an acquaintance with the classics was
thought becoming, nay, essential, to the character
of a gentleman. In the speeches and writings of
those days a due seasoning of allusions to the old
gods and a sprinkling of Latin quotations was
considered the proper thing. But this learning
was rather looked upon as solid and ponderous
furniture for the mind&mdash;an instrument of
mental discipline. Fancy, imagination, amusement,
were ideas much too light and frivolous to
be connected with anything so grave, solid and
respectable as the intellectual drill for which alone
Latin and Greek were intended. So when Isaac
Torrey talked about the old gods as if they had
been real existences, and spoke of Achilles, Hector
and Andromache as though they had been live
creatures, he rather startled the excellent young
divinity student who was his tutor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Once upon a time his father detecting a smell
of burning followed it up to Isaac&rsquo;s room, where
he found his son in the midst of a cloud of blue
smoke. He asked the cause, and was told that in
order to procure fair weather for the next day&rsquo;s
fishing excursion he (Isaac) had been sacrificing a
paper bull to Jupiter.</p>
<p>Mr. Torrey senior was inexpressibly shocked
at the thought that his son should have been guilty
of such a heathenish performance. He gave the
boy a lecture of an hour long, ending with a whipping.
He called in the minister to talk to him.
That gentleman, on being informed of the act of
idolatry perpetrated in his parish, only took a prodigious
pinch of snuff and said: &ldquo;Pooh! pooh!
child&rsquo;s play! child&rsquo;s play! No use to talk about
it. Let the boy alone.&rdquo; Mr. Torrey had the
highest respect for his clergyman, and the boy
<i>was</i> let alone accordingly, and was deeply grateful
to the Rev. Mr. Bartlett.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Isaac grew up tall and handsome, went to school
and to college, and in spite of numerous prophecies
that he would never be good for anything,
neither went into debt nor disgraced himself in
any way. In due course of time he succeeded to
his father&rsquo;s business, and astonished every one by
making money and being successful, in spite of
his tasteful dress, his &ldquo;wild ways&rdquo; of talking and
a report that he actually wrote poetry.</p>
<p>At the present time he was devoted to Miss
Anna Jane Shuttleworth, a beautiful still image of
a girl, who was supposed to have a great fund of
good sense, propriety, prudence and piety, because
she liked to sit still and sew from morning
to night, and hardly ever opened her lips. Ichabod
Sterns was the old clerk of Isaac&rsquo;s father. He
and his young master exasperated each other in
many ways, but they were fond of each other for
all that.</p>
<p>From the counting-house on the wharf and the
talk with Ichabod Sterns, Master Torrey went to
the workshop of Job Chippit, who in those days
was famous for his skill in the carving of figure-heads.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>In these times Job would probably have been a
sculptor, have gone to Rome and been famous in
marble and bronze. But the idea of such a thing
had never entered his brain, and he went on from
year to year making his wooden figures without
any thought of a higher calling. He was a little
dried, brown old man, with bright eyes slightly
near-sighted. Year after year he carved Indian
chiefs, eagles and wooden maidens for the Sally
Anns and Susan Janes that sailed from the New
England ports, portraits of public men, likenesses
of William and Mary. He had once made a full-length
figure of Oliver Cromwell for a certain stiff-necked
old merchant of Boston who called his
best ship after the great Protector&mdash;a statue which
every one thought his finest work. &ldquo;It was so
natural,&rdquo; said the good folks of Salem, and really I
don&rsquo;t know that they could have said anything
better even if they had been art critics and had
written for the newspapers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>True it was that all Job&rsquo;s works had a certain
live look to them that was almost startling sometimes.
The Indians clenched their hatchets with
a savageness quite alarming; they looked as
though they might open their wooden lips and
whoop. His female figures had life and character.
Each governor, senator or general had his own
peculiar expression and style.</p>
<p>Job was an artist, and, what was more, he was a
well-paid artist. He quite appreciated his own
genius, and got almost any prices he liked to ask
for his signs and figure-heads. Job was the fashion,
and no ship of any pretension sailed from a
harbor along the coast but carried one of his masterpieces
on the bow.</p>
<p>As Master Torrey entered his shop he was just
putting the last touches of paint on an oaken
bust destined to adorn Captain Peabody&rsquo;s little
schooner, The Flora. &ldquo;So you have nearly finished
The Flora&rsquo;s figure-head,&rdquo; said Master Torrey,
whose tastes led him to be a frequent visitor
at Job&rsquo;s shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a pretty creature she is,&rdquo; said Job, suspending
his paint-brush full of the yellow-brown
pigment with which he was tinging the rippled
hair of the wooden lady, which was crowned
with a garland of flowers carved with no mean
skill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the flowers! Don&rsquo;t you think they are
an improvement? What did Captain Peabody
say to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t jest like them at first,&rdquo; replied Job,
continuing his work. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t myself, to begin
with, for you know the ship is called after his wife,
and nobody ever see old Mis&rsquo; Peabody going
round with flowers in her hair; but the captain,
sez he, &lsquo;Job, I want to have you make it somethin&rsquo;
like what Mis&rsquo; Peabody was when she was a
young woman, ef you kin,&rsquo; sez he. &lsquo;She was a
most uncommon pretty girl when I went a-courting
in Salsbury.&rsquo; Well, I was kind of struck with the
idee, and the next day I went to meeting, and I
sot and sot, and kind of studied the old lady&rsquo;s face
all through meetin&rsquo;-time; and when they stood up
to sing, the choir sang &lsquo;Amsterdam.&rsquo; You know
it&rsquo;s a kind of livening sort of hymn. The old
lady, she kind of brightened up, and it seemed as
if I could see the young face sort of coming out behind
the old one. Thinks I, &lsquo;Job Chippit, you&rsquo;ve
got it,&rsquo; and when I come home, though it was the
Sabbath day, I couldn&rsquo;t hardly keep my hands off
the tools, and the minute the sun was down I went
at it. Then when you come in the next day and
told me about the Flora them old folks used to
think took care of the flowers and the spring, it
seemed to suit so well with my notion of the old
lady when she was young I couldn&rsquo;t help stickin&rsquo;
the flowers onto her head, like a fool as I was, for
they wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t in the bargain, and I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t get no
extry pay for &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what did Captain Peabody say?&rdquo; asked
Master Torrey, whose own nature found sympathy
in that of the artist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he was as tickled as could be when I&rsquo;d
persuaded him about the flowers. Lucy Peabody,
she&rsquo;s been to see it. She says she expects that&rsquo;s
the way her mother&rsquo;ll look when she gets to heaven,
and the flowers was like the crowns we read
about in the Revelations. She&rsquo;s an awful nice
girl, Lucy Peabody. Anna Jane Shuttleworth was
with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did <i>she</i> say?&rdquo; asked Master Torrey,
eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing. Anna Jane don&rsquo;t never have
much to say for herself. I told her the wreath
was your notion, and she kind of smiled, but she
hadn&rsquo;t a word to say. But look here, Master Torrey,
am I to have the making of the figure-head
for your new ship, and what is it to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I have come to see you about,
Job,&rdquo; said Master Torrey. &ldquo;I am going to call
her the Sea-nymph, and I want you to make the
most beautiful full-length figure of a sea-nymph
to stand on her bow and look across the water
when the brig goes sailing away into the South
Seas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <i>sea-nimp</i>!&rdquo; said Job; &ldquo;and what sort of a
critter may that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you never hear of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never as I know of. There&rsquo;s more fish in
the sea than ever come out of it. I expect these
nimps of yourn are some of the kind that never
come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never were more mistaken in your life,
Job Chippit. They have been seen on the surface
of the sea over and over again. We know
almost all their names, and how could they have
names if they were not real beings? Answer me
that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Job, standing back to take a general
survey of his wooden Flora. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re some
of them heathen young women your head is always
so full of, Master Torrey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young women! Why they were goddesses,
man, or a sort of goddesses. Was there not the
white-footed Thetis, mother of Achilles? and did
she not come to him with all her attendant nymphs&mdash;Melite,
and Doris, and Galatea, and Panope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hearn tell of <i>her</i>,&rdquo; said Job, touching up
the wreath on Flora&rsquo;s head; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s in Lycidas:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;The air was calm, and on the level brine</p>
<p class="t0"><i>Slick</i> Panope and all her sisters played.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jest so; I kinder like to read that piece. It
don&rsquo;t seem to have so very much meanin&rsquo; to&rsquo;t, I
must say, but I sort of like the sound of it. Them
nimps lived in the sea, or folks thought they did,
didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Job, as we live on the land. I&rsquo;m by no
means sure that I haven&rsquo;t heard and seen Nereides
and Oceanides myself when I&rsquo;ve been out by
moonlight on the bay or round the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they never was any round these parts;
it&rsquo;s too cold for &rsquo;em. I knew an old sailor once
that said he&rsquo;d seen a mermaid, but I suppose you
don&rsquo;t want me to stick a curly fish&rsquo;s tail on your
figure-head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed. Make her full length, like the
most beautiful woman you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hev&rsquo; you any idee how them young women
used to dress. Master Torrey?&rdquo; asked the wood-carver.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go as near the nature of the
critter as I could. I must say the notion takes my
fancy. It&rsquo;ll make kind of a variety, and it&rsquo;s a
pretty sort of an idee to name a ship after a thing
that has its life out the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d think so,&rdquo; said Master Torrey,
gratified. &ldquo;Ichabod Sterns said it was a heathenish
name for a ship that was to sail out of
Salem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know Ichabod. He hain&rsquo;t got
much notion of anything of that sort. But now
what&rsquo;s your notion of these &rsquo;ere water women?
Kinder cold-blooded critters they must have been,
I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo; There was something in this last
remark which seemed to grate on Master Torrey&rsquo;s
feelings, whatever they were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; he said, a little shortly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, because it&rsquo;s the natur&rsquo; of all the things in
the sea. It must have been but a damp, uncomfortable
way to live for warm-blooded folks; but tell
me what they were like, or do you happen to have
a picture of one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say I have not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they think they was like folks, or did
they live for ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some said they were immortal, others that
they were only very long-lived. Plutarch says
they lived more than nine thousand years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Creation! What awful old maids they must
have been! That&rsquo;s more than old Mrs. Skinner,
who was eighty-six when she married John Dickenson,
&rsquo;cause she said she wasn&rsquo;t going to have
&lsquo;Miss&rsquo; on her tombstone if she could help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then they always remained young and
lovely, never grew old or changed. They used to
say that whoever looked on an unveiled nymph
went mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waal, I&rsquo;d risk that if I could see one. But
they was kind of onlucky sort of critters, then,
after all?&rdquo; asked Job, who seemed to be inwardly
dwelling on some thought which he was keeping
out of the talk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to those who approached them rashly,
but they were kind to those who worshiped them
with reverence and offered them the gifts they
loved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waal, they wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t very peculiar in that. The
most of women is capable of being coaxed if you
only go to work the right way. I don&rsquo;t know how
it might have been with gals in the sea, but it ain&rsquo;t
best to be too dreadful diffident with the land kind
always,&rdquo; returned Job, with a sly smile. &ldquo;But
about this figure of ourn. I suppose it ought to
have some kind of a light gown on, and hadn&rsquo;t
they&mdash;them nimps?&mdash;got no emblem, nor nothing
of that sort, like Neptune&rsquo;s trident? I&rsquo;m going to
make a Neptune for a ship Peleg Brag&rsquo;s got. Her
name was The Ann Eliza. But the young woman
she was named for, she up and married Jonathan
Whitbeck, so Peleg, he&rsquo;s gont to call his ship The
Neptune now. It&rsquo;s the only way he can think of
to take it out on Ann Eliza, and I don&rsquo;t expect
that&rsquo;ll kill her; but didn&rsquo;t these <i>nimps</i> have nothing
about them to show what they were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes seaweeds, or coral and shells.
Sometimes they held a silver vase.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Waal, I reckon I&rsquo;ll take the vase, if it&rsquo;s agreeable
to you, and make her holding it out, and put
some seaweed and shells and sich onto her head,
and let her hair fly loose, as if the wind blew it
back. She won&rsquo;t want no shoes nor sandals, nor
nothing of that sort. What would be the use to a
critter that passes its life swimming round the
sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you understand. You&rsquo;ll make her a
beauty, Job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best. You&rsquo;ll want her to be a light-complected
young woman, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say the Nereides had green hair, but
Virgil says Arethusa&rsquo;s was golden, so we may make
our nymph&rsquo;s that color,&rdquo; said Master Torrey,
turning away to the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jes&rsquo; so; I&rsquo;ll go right to work. I must get
Lucy Peabody to put on a white gown and come
and let me look at her a little. She&rsquo;ll do it.
She&rsquo;s a real accommodating girl, is Lucy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Lucy is not fair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;No more she ain&rsquo;t. Not white as milk, like
Anna Jane Shuttleworth, but she&rsquo;s a nice, pretty
girl, and will be willing to oblige me. I&rsquo;d never
dare ask such a thing of old Colonel Shuttleworth&rsquo;s
daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Torrey smiled to himself as he thought
of the silent, stately Anna standing as a model in
the rude shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll give the figure a look like Anna Jane,
if I can,&rdquo; pursued Job. &ldquo;To my mind, she&rsquo;s a
great deal more like some such thing than she is
like a real flesh-and-blood woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Master Torrey made no answer, but
smiled at the old man&rsquo;s folly, and passed into the
street without even asking what would be the price
of the wooden sea-nymph.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small"><i>THE SEA KINGDOM.</i></span></h2>
<p>I take it for granted that all my readers
have heard of mermen and mermaids.
But in case any one&rsquo;s education should
have been neglected, I will just say that they are
like human beings, only that instead of legs they
have tails like dolphins, a fashion much more useful
in their element, and regarded by them as
much more ornamental, than the style in which
people are finished on land.</p>
<p>The merladies are very beautiful. They have
long, golden hair, and have often been seen sitting
on the rocks by the seaside, combing their locks
with their golden combs and holding a looking-glass.
They are also said to sing in the most
charming manner. I knew a Manx woman once
whose mother had seen a mermaid making her toilette.
She described the sea lady as wonderfully
beautiful, and &ldquo;singing in a way that would ravish
your heart.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;But as soon as she saw that she was watched,&rdquo;
said Katy, &ldquo;she gave a scream like a sea eagle
and dived into the water. No one ever saw her
again, but I&rsquo;ve heard the singing more than once
when I was young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the kingdoms of the sea and their
inhabitants Hans Anderson has written a pretty
story, which I hope you have all read. The fullest
account, however, that I know of the mer countries
is in the Arabian Nights, Lane&rsquo;s translation,
where you will find the story of &ldquo;Abdalla of the
Land and Abdalla of the Sea.&rdquo; It is a pity that
the date and place of this interesting narration is
left so uncertain, for to some minds it throws an
air of improbability over the whole story; however,
it is certainly the most authentic account of
the world under the waters. So far as I know,
&ldquo;Abdalla of the Land&rdquo; is the only person who
has ever associated familiarly with mermen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>There was, to be sure, Gulnare of the Sea, who
married the King of Khorassan and introduced
her family to that monarch. But she was not a
proper merwoman, being destitute of their peculiar
appendage, and being, moreover, related to
the Genii and Afrites of those parts.</p>
<p>But in the chronicle of Abdalla you will find
much that is curious and interesting. There you
may read concerning the &ldquo;dendan,&rdquo; that tremendous
fish which is able to swallow an elephant
at a mouthful; and, by the way, if you wish to
descend into the sea undrowned, you have only to
anoint yourself with the fat of the dendan. But
the difficulty seems to be in catching this monster,
who eats mermen whenever he can find them.
You, however, are in no danger even if you happen
to fall in his way, for he dies &ldquo;whenever he
hears the voice of a son of Adam.&rdquo; So if you
should fall in with a dendan, you have only to
scream at the top of your voice and be quite safe.
But concerning these wonders and many more I
have no time to write, seeing that if you can get
the book you can read it for yourself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Now there are just as many mermen and mermaids
along the American coasts as there are anywhere
else, though they very seldom show themselves.
I heard, indeed, of a sailor who had seen
one in Passamaquoddy Bay, but I did not have the
pleasure of conversing with this mariner myself,
so I am unable to state as an absolute fact that a
mermaid was seen.</p>
<p>If any of you are at the seaside in the summer,
you can keep a sharp lookout, and there is no telling
what you may see. You would find an alliance
with a mer-person very advantageous if we
may judge by the experience of Abdalla. Jewels
in the sea are as common as pebbles with us, and
in return for a little fruit a merman will give you
bushels of precious stones.</p>
<p>You must be a little careful, however, not to
offend them, for it would seem that some of them
are rather touchy and apt to be intolerant of other
people&rsquo;s opinion in matters of doctrine and practice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Now, not far from the Massachusetts coast, out
beyond the bay, is a very beautiful sea country.
There are mountains as big as Mount Washington,
whose tops, just covered by the sea, are bare rock,
but which are clothed around their base with the
most beautiful seaweed, golden green and purple
and crimson. Through these seaweeds wander all
manner of strange creatures, such as human eyes
have never seen, for there is no truer proverb than
that &ldquo;There are more fish in the sea than ever
came out of it.&rdquo; There are miles and miles of
gray-green weed and emerald moss where the sea
cows and sea horses find pasture. There, too, are
the cities and villages of the merpeople, and
many a pleasant home standing in the midst of the
beautiful sea gardens, blossoming with strange
flowers and bright with strange fruit.</p>
<p>The houses are grottoes and caves hollowed out
of the rock, and for the most part very handsomely
furnished, for there is a great deal of
wealth among the sea people. They have not
only all the mineral wealth of the sea, but they
have all the treasures that have been lost in the
deep ever since men first began to sail the waters.
Their soft carpets are made of sea-green wool that
the sea people comb and weave, for they are skillful
in the arts and manufactures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>They have soft, lace-like fabrics woven of seaweed,
silks and satins that the water does not hurt.
There is no coral on our Northern shores, but they
import it, and pay in exchange with oysters and
looking-glasses. The sea ladies dress in the most
beautiful things you can imagine, that is, when
they dress at all, for in warm weather they generally
make their appearance in a light suit of their
own hair with a zone and necklace of pearls or
jewels.</p>
<p>This country that I am writing about has a republican
form of government, and is very prosperous
and comfortable. It is a long time since any
foreign power has made war upon it, and it has
had time to grow and develop its resources. But
at the time of which I write they had just finished
a seven years&rsquo; war with the king of a country lying
to the east who had tried to annex the sea republic
to his own dominions. This monarch had
counted on a very easy conquest because the republic
kept a very small army, not big enough
really to keep down the sharks. Moreover, there
was a large &ldquo;Peace Society&rdquo; in the country, every
member of which had maintained repeatedly, in
the most public manner, that it was the duty of
every member to be invaded and killed a dozen
times over rather than lift up his hand in war
against any creature with mer blood in his veins.
The king thought this talk of theirs really meant
something, I suppose they thought so themselves
in peace-times, but when the annual meeting
came, about a week after the declaration of
war, only two members made their appearance,
and they told each other that all the men of
the society had enlisted and all the women were
busy making their clothes and packing their
knapsacks. The king was very much surprised to
find that these peaceable soldiers fought harder
than any one else, and when he was at last forced
to conclude peace on the most humiliating terms,
it was the ex-President of the non-resistance society
that insisted on a surrender of his most important
frontier fortress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you believed in non-resistance,&rdquo;
said the king, greatly disgusted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I do, your majesty, for other people,&rdquo; said
the ex-President, respectfully, and the king had to
give way.</p>
<p>But this is not a chronicle of the politics and
history of the sea country, but only of one particular
merman&rsquo;s fortunes. Our merman was young
and very handsome, and belonged to a very distinguished
family in his own state. It was said
that they were in some way connected with that
royal race to which belonged Gulnare of the
Sea&mdash;she who married the King of Khorassan. It
was whispered that the family were descended from
a younger son of this pair, who had married a mer
lady, and displeased both her family and his to
such an extent by the marriage that they had left
the Eastern seas and emigrated to the English
waters, and from there into the new sea lands of
the West.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>All these things, if they were true, must have
happened centuries before my merman was born.
The legend was well known, and if it was founded
on fact, the family had human blood in their veins
and a cross of sea genii, for Gulnare was, as you
will remember, not quite a flesh-and-blood woman.
However, the humanity in them was at least royal
humanity, and the King of Khorassan, as the story
goes, was a very fine gentleman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>All the people of that country were fair-haired,
big-boned people, with blue eyes, but the race I
am writing about were black haired and dark eyed,
with slender hands. They were rather delicate
and slight in their appearance, and they had a peculiarly
graceful way of carrying their tails, a
manner quite indescribable in its elegance, but a
family mark. They were rather more intellectual
than their countrymen and were fond of literary
pursuits and the study of magic, which in the sea
land is considered as a very essential part of a
gentleman&rsquo;s education. It is taught only in the
higher schools and colleges.</p>
<p>Our merman&rsquo;s old grandfather (his father was
dead) was Professor of Magic in the State University,
and so expert in his own science that he could
turn himself into an oyster so perfect that you
could not tell him from the genuine article. It
was said that once while in that condition he had
been nearly swallowed by a member of the Freshman
class. For this offence the young merman
was called up before the Faculty. He apologized
very humbly, and said his only motive had been
to see if he couldn&rsquo;t for once get the professor to
agree with him. He professed himself very penitent,
and was let off with a reprimand, but he said
afterward that his great mistake had been in waiting
for the pepper and vinegar. After this accident
the professor could never be induced to repeat
the performance except in a small circle of
his intimate friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Now, there was one curious thing about this
family, and one which makes me think there was
some truth in the legend of their descent from
Gulnare and the King of Khorassan.</p>
<p>All the other merpeople have the greatest objection
to human beings, and shun all inhabited
coasts, seaport towns and ships. But every once
in a while a member of this race would show the
oddest fancy for the shore and a kind of longing
after human society&mdash;a longing which of course
they never could gratify, for they could not live
out of the water, and if they had been able to desert
the sea, the forked ends of their long tails
would have been of no use on land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>A few years before the family left the English
coast, a younger son had actually married a human
girl who went back to her friends and deserted
him on the shamefully false pretence that she
wanted to go to church. The poor merman went
out of his wits and died, and was ever afterward
held up as an example to any of the younger ones
who showed any signs of similar weakness. To
care anything for human creatures is counted disgraceful
in mer society, and the older members of
the family for the most part felt it their duty to
express the greatest possible animosity to the
whole human race. The old professor of magic
had once said that he would swim a hundred
miles to see a shipwreck if he were only sure the
people would all be drowned, but he was strongly
suspected of having saved a drunken sailor who
fell overboard from a Cape Cod schooner. The
professor himself used to deny this story with
great indignation, and say it was of a piece with
the slanderous invention about his family&rsquo;s connection
with Gulnare of the sea and her misalliance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>His grandson, however, if the story was hinted
at in his presence, would look grave and say that
he had never supposed the story was true, but if it
were, his grandfather had only obeyed the dictates
of mermanity. This was a shocking speech in the
ears of the merpeople. Our young merman,
however, had distinguished himself in the war,
and no one cared to quarrel with him. So they
contented themselves with calling him &ldquo;queer,&rdquo;
and saying that &ldquo;oddity ran in the family.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p class="tb">It was the summer vacation in the sea land. All
the commencements in the mer colleges were just
over. All the presidents of those institutions had
made their speeches in languages dead and alive,
and told all their classes what an enormous responsibility
rested upon them, how they were bound to
&ldquo;go forward,&rdquo; and &ldquo;to conquer,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;build
themselves up,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;develop themselves,&rdquo;
and be &ldquo;leaders of their kind,&rdquo; and, in short, do
something in proportion to the expense bestowed
on their education. This is a way they have in
sea land. But naturally in the sea they take
things cooler than we can on land, and you
wouldn&rsquo;t believe how very little difference the advent
of all these expensively got up young mermen
made in the water world if you had not been there
to see. Now the old mer professor hadn&rsquo;t had a
very comfortable time. His class that year was
rather a stupid one, and with all the pains he
could take and all the &ldquo;coaches&rdquo; they could use
they hadn&rsquo;t passed a very good examination in
magic. One young gentleman upon whom he
had thought he could certainly depend being told
to make himself invisible, which is a very difficult
problem, had made a mistake, used the wrong
formula, and by accident transformed the whole
Board of Examiners, who were not expecting any
such thing, into cuttle-fishes. There was dreadful
confusion for a few minutes, for the student
couldn&rsquo;t remember how to turn them back again,
and as the spell could not be undone by any one
else, the members of the board got all tangled up
together, while the professor, in an awful temper,
was trying to teach the young man the right formula.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p040.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="781" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;And by accident transformed the whole board of examiners into cuttle-fishes.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>But they were all undone at last, only there was
one immensely wealthy old merman who was never
quite sure in his mind that he had got back his
own proper curly fish&rsquo;s tail, and not that of some
other gentleman, so that all the rest of his life he
was in a puzzle as to at least half his personal identity.
This incident so vexed him that he did not
give anything to the college funds, as he had fully
intended. This circumstance and a few other accidents
had so annoyed the professor that instead
of going to the North Seas with his grandson he
shut himself up in the house and began to write a
book. The book was in opposition to a theory
put forth by a learned merman in the Baltic Sea
that human beings were undeveloped mermen.
The professor, however, declared that they were
no such thing, but simply undeveloped walruses.
He began his first chapter by saying that, while he
had the highest respect for the Baltic merman&rsquo;s
acquirements, intellect, penetration and general
infallibility, he nevertheless felt himself obliged
to declare that none but an idiot or a madman
could come to the conclusion of the learned man
aforesaid. He (the professor) wished to lay down
his platform in the beginnings and state that he
differed from the opinions of the learned author
on this and all other conceivable points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d a good deal better go along with me,
grandfather,&rdquo; said the young merman, swimming
into the room where the professor was sitting with
his big books all about him. &ldquo;Think how nice
and cool it will be among the icebergs this hot
weather. Hadn&rsquo;t you better come?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the old professor, snapping and
switching his tail angrily round in the water, for
the houses there are full of water, as ours are of
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you would, sir,&rdquo; said the young
merman; &ldquo;I said you&rsquo;d better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever know me say I would do a thing
when I did?&rdquo; returned the professor, angrily.
&ldquo;I mean, did you ever know me say I did do a
thing when I would? Pooh! Pshaw! That
isn&rsquo;t what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; said his grandson, respectfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; said the professor,
sharply. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s that catfish mewing at the
door. Get up and let her in, do, and make yourself
useful for once in your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young merman got up and opened the door
for the catfish, which came swimming in, followed
by two little kitten fish. These, frisking playfully
around the room, soon overset the professor&rsquo;s ink-stand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said the professor to his grandson.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all your fault! What did you let them
in for? Open the windows and let in some fresh
water, do. Scat! scat! you little torments! I
don&rsquo;t believe the cook has given them their dinner;
she never does unless I see to it myself; your
sisters forget them. No, I&rsquo;m not going to the
North Seas; I can&rsquo;t spare the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you can, sir?&rdquo; said the young
merman. &ldquo;What odds does it make about those
forked creatures on land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know this fellow has the impudence
to pretend that they are undeveloped mermen,
that they&rsquo;ll be just like ourselves after a series of
ages when their two legs grow into one, and that
our ancestors were actually of the same type as
those low creatures that go about in ships? But
perhaps you agree with him, sir?&rdquo; said the old
professor, with a look that seemed to say that if
he did he might expect to be annihilated on the
spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I, sir. For aught I know we mermen
may be undeveloped human beings. I&rsquo;ve sometimes
thought so, I have such a sort of longing
for the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you&mdash;?&rdquo; began the old gentleman in
great indignation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, grandfather,&rdquo; said the young
merman, smiling. &ldquo;You are not angry with
me I know; I presume you&rsquo;ve felt just so yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The professor was silent, and swam thoughtfully
two or three times up and down the room. The
two little kitten fish went and sat on his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say but I have,&rdquo; he remarked at
length, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s best not to mention it. Where
do you mean to go for your vacation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I should go North along the coast,&rdquo;
said the young merman. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help having
a curiosity about the land, and if I am in a way to
observe any human creatures, I may pick up some
facts to support your theory that they are undeveloped
walruses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any one can see that who has ever seen them
floundering about in the water,&rdquo; said the old professor,
scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the men drown and the walruses don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because the men have not yet acquired
the habit of not being drowned,&rdquo; said the professor.
&ldquo;When are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the professor. &ldquo;Swim away
with you now, and tell the cook to feed these kittens;
there they are nibbling the hair off my
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day the young merman set off on his
travels. He bade good-bye to no one but his
grandfather and his two sisters. His best friend
was away as bearer of despatches to the secretary
of state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he wouldn&rsquo;t go near the coast,&rdquo; said
the older sister, wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said the younger; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid for
him. But, sister, now honestly, don&rsquo;t you wish
you could see a human creature near enough to
speak to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not I,&rdquo; said the elder, who had less of
the family traits than any of her relations; &ldquo;I wish
you wouldn&rsquo;t say such silly things.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Just as the young merman was going out of the
front door, he met a huge lobster coming into it,
and without ringing. The young merman felt
that this was a liberty in the lobster, and was sure
that his grandfather would not be pleased.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better go round to the back door?&rdquo;
he said, quietly.</p>
<p>Now the lobster was no less than the old Witch
of the Sea in disguise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Round to the back door indeed!&rdquo; shrieked
the lobster. &ldquo;Do you know who I am, young
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the young merman;
&ldquo;I had no idea you were any one in particular.
The servant will admit you if you wish to see the
professor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said the lobster, in a huff, &ldquo;but I
won&rsquo;t;&rdquo; and she turned round and swam away.</p>
<p>The professor saw her out of the window. He
knew who it was well enough, but he did not like
the Witch of the Sea. He thought females had no
business to study magic, and he said she practiced
her art in a most irregular manner. Moreover,
she could do two or three things which he couldn&rsquo;t,
so he naturally held her in contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahrr! you old fool!&rdquo; cried the lobster,
shaking her claw at him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>But the professor pretended to take no notice.
&ldquo;Those low-bred people always call names,&rdquo; he
said to himself. &ldquo;What an old humbug she is,
and what idiots people are to go to her for advice!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The merman went swimming on his way, but as
he swam he passed a garden. It was rather a
large garden, shut in by a hedge of sea flag and
tangle, with pink and white shells glittering here
and there among the leaves. Behind the garden
was a very lofty and spacious grotto, where lived
a family with whom the professor&rsquo;s household was
very intimate. The merman paused a minute, for
some one in the garden was singing. The singer
had a voice that would have made people on land
go wild to hear her. If you can imagine a wood-thrush
multiplied by fifty and singing articulate
music, you can have some idea of the mermaid&rsquo;s
voice. But in the sea every one can sing, and
they don&rsquo;t care much more for it than we do here
for public speaking. She was singing a silly little
song, but it was joined to a sweet air, and the
words were of no great consequence:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;My goodman march&egrave;d down the street,</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;Good-bye, my dear, good-bye,&rsquo; said he;</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Good-bye, my dear;&rsquo; it might be ne&rsquo;er</p>
<p class="t">Would he come back again to me.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Good-bye, my love,&rsquo; I said aloud;</p>
<p class="t">I kept my smile, I did not cry;</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Good-bye, my own,&rsquo; and he was gone,</p>
<p class="t">And who was left so lone as I!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;It was so long, so very long,</p>
<p class="t">I kept myself so calm and still;</p>
<p class="t0">The days went on, the time was gone,</p>
<p class="t">I lost my hope and I fell ill.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I could not rest, I could not sleep,</p>
<p class="t">I hid myself from every eye;</p>
<p class="t0">And wearing care to dumb despair</p>
<p class="t">Was changed, and yet I did not cry.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;My goodman came up the street,</p>
<p class="t">And from the street he called to me;</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Look out, my dear, for I am here,</p>
<p class="t">And safe returned to comfort thee.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;My tears fell down like summer rain,</p>
<p class="t">I could not rise to ope the door,</p>
<p class="t0">Though once again, so firm and plain,</p>
<p class="t">I heard his step upon the floor.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I was so glad, so very glad,</p>
<p class="t">I had to cry and so did he;</p>
<p class="t0">But wars are o&rsquo;er, and now no more</p>
<p class="t">My goodman goes away from me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you?&rsquo;&rdquo; called the merman when the
song was done.</p>
<p>Just over the hedge was a little arbor covered
with trailing sea-plants. As the merman spoke,
two little white hands parted the broad crimson
leaves of a dulse that hung over the door, then
there swam out one of the loveliest mermaids in
the whole sea. Her yellow hair shone like gold,
and was full two yards long as it trailed on the
water, for mermaids never wear their hair any
other way. Her complexion was like the inside
of a pink-and-white shell, and her eyes were like
two clear, still pools of water, they were so pure
and deep. As for the mer part of her, the dolphin&rsquo;s
tail, I declare it was only an additional
beauty, she managed it so gracefully. I can&rsquo;t begin
to tell you how beautiful she was. She was a very
intimate friend of the merman&rsquo;s sister, and he had
known her all his life&mdash;ever since they used to
chase the fishes round the garden and in and out
of the rocks, and make baby-houses together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; said the mermaid to
the merman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only North a little for my vacation trip.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;Without saying good-bye?&rdquo; said the mermaid,
smiling as though she did not care a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;d come home till I heard
you singing, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be gone long; what shall
I bring you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tame seal to play with, if you can remember
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tie a string round my finger,&rdquo; said the merman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can wear this,&rdquo; she said, holding up a
seal ring of red carnelian. &ldquo;I found it in the
garden; I suppose it belonged to some human
being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a large seal ring, having two interlaced
triangles cut in the stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a spell,&rdquo; said the merman; &ldquo;it will
keep away evil spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then wear it,&rdquo; said the mermaid, holding it
out to him, and he slipped it on his finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t forget the
tame seal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not; I&rsquo;ll be home in time to dance
at your birth-day party.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>The mermaid swam away to the house, turning
at the door to wave her hand to her old playmate,
but he did not see her. His two sisters had
watched their interview from an upper window of
their own house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has no more eyes in his head than an oyster,&rdquo;
said the elder, in quite a pet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be so nice,&rdquo; said the younger, with
a sigh. &ldquo;It would be just the thing for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, and that&rsquo;s the reason why he never
thinks of it,&rdquo; said the elder, who had more experience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small"><i>THE FIGURE-HEAD.</i></span></h2>
<p>In the mean time, a most beautiful thing
had grown out of the oak block in Job
Chippit&rsquo;s shop.</p>
<p>Day by day Job worked at the figure-head of
the Sea-nymph, Master Torrey&rsquo;s beautiful new
brig that was lying on the stocks all but ready for
the launch. Job spared no pains on his work,
and his wonderful success really astonished himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Every one wanted to see the new figure-head,
but Job kept it locked up in an inner room, and
would admit no one but Master Torrey and Lucy
Peabody. Lucy had been willing to put on a
white dress and stand for a model, but the figure
did not look at all like Lucy. It was taller, more
slender, and the features were nothing like hers.
Once or twice Lucy had persuaded Anna Jane
Shuttleworth with her into Job&rsquo;s shop. The old
man had studied her face, and worked every moment
of the young lady&rsquo;s stay. He stared at
Anna in meeting-time in a way that almost disturbed
that young woman&rsquo;s composure, but she
looked straight before her and took no notice. It
was impossible to tell how she felt. Anna was
always &ldquo;very reserved,&rdquo; people said. They had
an idea that treasures of wisdom, good sense and
virtue were at once indicated and concealed by
that statue-like air and silence.</p>
<p>Master Torrey was delighted with the nymph,
which was, indeed, most beautiful. She stood on
a point of rock, leaning lightly forward. Her
rounded arms upheld a silvered vase of antique
fashion; her head was thrown back; her hair,
crowned with seaweed and coral, streamed over
her shoulders as though blown by the same breeze
that wafted back the thin robe from her dainty
feet and ankles; the face was of the regular classic
type, yet not quite human in its cold purity; the
eyes looked out over the sea toward the far horizon.
It was really quite extraordinary how the
old Yankee wood-carver could have accomplished
such a work of art. It looked, also, as if it might,
if it chose, open its lips and speak, but you were
quite certain it never would choose, it was so life-like
and yet so still.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Job had sent to Boston and procured finer colors
than he had ever used before, and laid them on with
a cunning hand. He had painted the sea lady&rsquo;s
robe a pale sea-green; over it fell her hair&mdash;not
yellow with golden lights, but soft flaxen; the
eyes were blue, and the faintest sea-shell pink
tinged the lips and cheeks. It was altogether the
most beautiful figure-head that any one had ever
seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! I reckon she&rsquo;s about done,&rdquo; said Job
as he laid down his last brush and stood contemplating
his work. There was an odd look on the
old man&rsquo;s face, half satisfaction, half dislike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a pretty cretur, ain&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; he said to
Lucy Peabody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful,&rdquo; said Lucy, but speaking with a
slight effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like her?&rdquo; said Job in a doubtful
tone.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p054.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="777" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you like her?&rsquo; said Job, in a doubtful tone.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very beautiful, Uncle Job, but&mdash;but&rdquo;&mdash;and
Lucy hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t want any one I
cared for to love a woman like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waal, I can&rsquo;t say&rsquo;s I would myself,&rdquo; said Job.
&ldquo;But this ain&rsquo;t a woman, you see; it&rsquo;s one of
them nimps. They wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t like real human girls,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she is not kind,&rdquo; said Lucy, with a little
shiver. &ldquo;She would see men drowning before her
eyes, and would not put out her hand to help them.
I think she took those pearl bracelets and her necklace
from some poor dead girl she found floating
in the sea. She wouldn&rsquo;t mind; she would only
care to dress herself with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say but that&rsquo;s my notion of her too,&rdquo;
said Job. &ldquo;Do you know, Lucy,&rdquo; he continued,
in a lower voice, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help feeling as if there
was something more than common in this bit of
wood all the while I&rsquo;ve been doing it? It seemed
as if &rsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t me that was making of it up, but I
was jest like some kind of a machine going along
on some one else&rsquo;s notion. Sometimes I am half
skeered at the critter myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;You meant to make her like Anna Jane
Shuttleworth, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Lucy, suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waal, yis, I did kind o&rsquo; mean to give her a
look of Anna Jane, &rsquo;cause Torrey, he&rsquo;s so set on
her, but I&rsquo;ve got it more like her than I meant.
Somehow, it seems as if it was more like her than
she is herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucy gave one more long look at the figure
&ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; she said, with a little start. &ldquo;Good-bye,
Uncle Job;&rdquo; and she flitted away by a side
door.</p>
<p>Just then Master Torrey came into the shop, and
with him came old Colonel Shuttleworth and his
daughter. Colonel Shuttleworth was a pompous,
portly man, in an embroidered waistcoat, plum-colored
coat and lace ruffles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty thing! a pretty thing!&rdquo; he said, condescendingly.
&ldquo;How many guineas has she cost
Master Torrey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t expect I was going to make her
for nothing, did you, cunnel?&rdquo; said Job, who
stood in no awe of the old man&rsquo;s wealth, clothes
or title.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, of course not,&rdquo; said the colonel, trying
to be dignified. &ldquo;Um! ah! it seems to me
this figure has something the look of my daughter.
Anna, isn&rsquo;t the new figure-head like you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; said Anna, who had
dropped into a seat and sat looking at nothing in
particular.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s so delicate, so modest, she won&rsquo;t notice,&rdquo;
thought her lover. &ldquo;She is lovely, Job,&rdquo;
he cried aloud. &ldquo;You have outdone yourself.
Our sea lady is no mortal, but a goddess. She
has everything noble in humanity, but none of its
faults or weaknesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; said Job; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that.
I&rsquo;ve heard some of them goddesses was rather
queer-acted people. Anyhow, I think I&rsquo;d like the
women folks best, not being a heathen god myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Job, you don&rsquo;t understand your own
work,&rdquo; said Master Torrey, half angrily. &ldquo;She
is too pure to be moved by our passions, too much
exalted above humanity to be agitated by its troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;Waal now, that ain&rsquo;t my notion of exaltation,&rdquo;
said Job. &ldquo;&lsquo;Seems to me that&rsquo;s more like havin&rsquo;
no feelin&rsquo;s at all, kind of too dull and stupid and
full of herself to keer very much about anything.
This wooden girl of ourn is uncommon handsome,
though I say it, but bless you, Master Torrey! she
hain&rsquo;t got no more brains in her skull than a minnow.
She&rsquo;d be a kind of dead-and-alive sort of a
critter always. If she had a husband, she&rsquo;d never
bother herself if he was in trouble. If she had a
baby, she wouldn&rsquo;t care much for it, only maybe
to dress it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man seemed strangely excited in this
absurd discussion. Master Torrey, too, seemed
much disturbed and not a little provoked. Anna
Jane sat calm and still, and wondered whether
that light green color in the nymph&rsquo;s robe would
become her. The colonel, who had not the faintest
idea what the two men were talking about,
looked from one to the other uncomprehending,
and consequently slightly offended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you talking about this wooden image?&rdquo;
he said, wondering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to be sure, cunnel,&rdquo; said Job, with an
odd sound between a laugh and a groan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come, child, it is time to go home,&rdquo; said the
colonel, loftily.</p>
<p>Anna Jane rose and took her father&rsquo;s arm.
Master Torrey followed them out of the shop without
looking back or saying good-bye to his old
friend. In a strange passion, Job caught up the
axe and looked at the wooden nymph as if about
to dash it in pieces. &ldquo;What an old fool I am!&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;<i>She</i> ain&rsquo;t only wood, and I&rsquo;ll get my
pay for her. <i>Creation!</i> it does beat all how contrary
things turn out in this world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figure-head of the Sea-nymph was carried
through the streets in the midst of an admiring
throng and fixed securely in its place on the beautiful
new brig. A few days more, and the ship
was launched and slid swiftly and safely into the
sea. That night it was bright moonlight. Silver-gilt
ripples were rising and falling along the coast
and all over the bay. Now and then a fish would
jump, scattering a shower of shining drops. Everything
was very still around the Sea-nymph.
She lay quite by herself at some distance from any
other craft. There was no one on board but an
old watchman, who was fast asleep. If he had
been awake, he would have seen a long, bright
ripple on the water coming nearer as some sea
creature cut its way swiftly toward the new craft.
It was our merman, who found himself drawn toward
the land by a longing curiosity too strong
for him to resist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is all so quiet and still,&rdquo; he thought.
&ldquo;There can be no possible danger, and I do so
want to see what sort of houses these human creatures
live in. There&rsquo;s a new ship. I&rsquo;m a great
mind to go and look at it. What is that standing
there on the end of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merman swam on slowly, debating whether
he should really go and look. Something seemed
at once to warn him away and to call him forward.
He could not tell what was the matter
with him. Once he turned to swim away. Then
he made up his mind once for all, and dashed
straight on toward the ship. He said over to himself
a charm his grandfather had taught him:
&ldquo;Aski, kataski, lix tetrax, damnamenous,&rdquo; words
of power once written on the fish-bodied statue of
the great goddess of Ephesus; but, dear me! it did
him no good at all. All the while he was coming
the wooden nymph stood up in her place, holding
out her silver vase in both hands and looking over
the sea with her painted eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a lovely creature!&rdquo; thought the merman.
&ldquo;She is looking at me; she holds her vase
toward me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was doing no such thing, of course&mdash;the
wooden image&mdash;but he thought she was. He did
not know that she would have looked just the
same way if he had been an old porpoise instead
of a young merman. He swam closer and closer.
The moon shone on the painted face. The ship
moved gently on the water. The merman thought
the lady had inclined her head. In one moment
he fell desperately, helplessly, in love with the
oaken nymph. It certainly must have been the
doing of the old Witch of the Sea. Some influence
of the kind must have been at work, or else a merman
who had been to college would surely have
had more sense than to become enamored of an
oak block. But whether it was the witch&rsquo;s work,
or whether it was the drop of human blood in his
veins, or whether it was fate, that is just what he
did&mdash;he fell in love with a wooden image. He
forgot his home, his old grandfather, his sisters,
his best friend, who loved him like a brother and
who had saved his life in the war. As for the
mermaid who had given him the ring, he never
gave her a thought. He didn&rsquo;t care for anything
in the world but that painted image smiling up
there and holding its vase. He saw nothing but
that, and, in fact, he didn&rsquo;t see that either, for he
saw it as if it were alive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I wish I knew her name or what she is!&rdquo;
said the merman to himself. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t be human.
She is too beautiful.&rdquo; He swam round
and round and read the words &ldquo;The Sea-nymph&rdquo;
painted under the figure. He gave a jump almost
out of the water. &ldquo;It is a nymph,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;one
of the Nereides or Oceanides. I thought they had
left this world long ago. What can she be doing
on that ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gazed at the wooden creature with all his
heart in his eyes. He wished he were human that
he might at least be a little like this lovely shape.
He hated his own form. Was it likely the divine
nymph would ever deign to notice a creature with
a fish&rsquo;s tail? Finally he ventured to speak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fairest nymph,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He got no answer, but as the shadow of a cloud
flitted across her face, and then the moon shone on
her, he thought the nymph smiled. If there had
been any possible way, he would certainly have
climbed up to her, though he knew he could not live
five minutes out of the water. He did not think
anything about that, the poor silly merman. He
was so infatuated that he would have been glad to
die beside her. He stayed there the whole night
talking to the wooden sea-nymph, and when the
image moved with the rise and fall of the water he
thought she inclined her head toward him. He
said the most extravagant things to her; he told
her all he had ever thought or felt, things he had
never spoken to his best friend who loved him
dearly; he poured out all his heart into the deaf
ears of the wooden nymph. The image kept looking
out over the water with its painted eyes, and
the merman thought, &ldquo;Now at last I have found
some one who can understand me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was growing to gray dawn when a huge sea
gull came sweeping over the water, and poised
and hovered over the merman&rsquo;s head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; said the sea-gull to the merman,
&ldquo;what are <i>you</i> up to, young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merman was disgusted and made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better clear out of this,&rdquo; said the gull.
&ldquo;If they catch you, they&rsquo;ll make a show of you
and wheel you round the streets in a tub of water
for sixpence a sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be so good as to reserve your anxiety for your
own affairs,&rdquo; said the merman, haughtily. He
had always been sweet-tempered, but now he felt
as if he must have a quarrel with some one. He
had a general impression that every living creature
was his rival and enemy. He didn&rsquo;t just know
what he wanted, but he was determined to have it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Highty tighty!&rdquo; said the sea-gull. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
put yourself out. What have we here? A pretty
wooden image, upon my word!&rdquo; and the gull
perched on the sea-nymph&rsquo;s head and scratched
his ear with one claw. The merman went almost
wild at the sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You profane wretch!&rdquo; he shouted; &ldquo;how
dare you? Oh, good heavens, that I should see
her so insulted and not be able to help her. Oh,
why can&rsquo;t I fly?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause you hain&rsquo;t got no wings,&rdquo; said the
vulgar bird, flapping his own wide white pinions.
&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I perch here as well as on any
other post? It&rsquo;s none of your funeral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Post!&rdquo; said the merman, in a fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, post! Why? You don&rsquo;t mean to say
you think this thing&rsquo;s alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alive! She is a goddess, a nymph, an angel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you <i>are</i> a muff,&rdquo; said the gull, with immense
contempt. &ldquo;If I ever! Look here! if
you don&rsquo;t want a harpoon in you, you had better
quit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wring your neck,&rdquo; said the merman, in a
rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skee-ee-eek!&rdquo; screamed the gull. &ldquo;Will you
have it now or wait till you get it? Take your
own way, if you only know what it is;&rdquo; and the
gull lifted his wings and swept off over the water,
laughing frantically. The wooden lady kept looking
over the sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;What noble composure! what breeding!&rdquo;
thought the merman. &ldquo;She scorns to notice a
creature like that. How much more noble and
womanly is this modest reserve and silence than
the chatter and laughing of our mermaids!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It grew lighter and lighter; sounds of life were
heard from the shore; a boat put out on the bay;
presently the workmen began to come on board
the brig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any of those human beings can speak to her,&rdquo;
thought the merman. He was frantically jealous
of an old ship carpenter with a wooden leg.</p>
<p>One of the workmen caught a glimpse of him.
&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s an odd fish! Who&rsquo;s
got a harpoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merman had just sense enough left to see
that if he was harpooned in the morning he
couldn&rsquo;t court the goddess at night. He dived
and swam away, for mermen, although they are
warm-blooded animals, are not obliged to come
up to the top of the water to breathe.</p>
<p>He hid all day long under the timbers of an old
wharf, and when it was still at night he came out
again and swam toward The Sea-nymph. Some
one had covered up the figure with an old sheet
to keep the dust off. The merman thought she
had put on a veil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;What charming modesty!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She
don&rsquo;t wish to be seen by these human beings, or
perhaps I offended her by my staring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He called her every lovely name he could invent
or think of. He got no answer, of course,
but that was her feminine reserve, the merman
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speech is silvern, silence is golden,&rdquo; he said.
So it went on all the time the new brig was being
fitted up. The merman lived a wretched life.
Two or three times he was seen and chased by the
fishermen. A talk went about of the odd creature
that haunted the water near the new ship. Some
one was always on the lookout for him, and once
he was nearly caught. They kept watch for him
at night. It was only now and then that he could
worship his wooden love for an hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>All the time the old sheet was over her head, but
the merman only loved her the better. He hid
under the old wharf by day, for though he knew
how to make himself invisible to mermen, the
charm hadn&rsquo;t the slightest effect where Yankees
were concerned. He lived on whatever he could
catch, but he had very little appetite. The shallow
harbor water did not agree with his constitution.
He grew thin and hollow-eyed, a mere
ghost of a merman, but he was constant to his
wooden image.</p>
<p>Meantime, the ship was finished and the cargo
was stowed away. One day, glancing out from
his place, he saw that the nymph was unveiled
and was standing in her old fashion, lovely as ever.
She was looking straight at him, the merman
thought. &ldquo;She is anxious about my safety,&rdquo; he
said, with delight, for he did not know that the
image just looked toward the old wharf because it
happened to be in the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I would follow you over
the whole ocean for such a look as that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night there were so many men on board
the brig that the merman did not dare go near her.
The next morning the ship spread her sails and
went out of the harbor with a fair wind, bound
for Lisbon and the Mediterranean. That same
evening there was a great gathering at Colonel
Shuttleworth&rsquo;s. Master Torrey was married to
Anna Jane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>The merman followed the ship at a long distance.
He dared not go too near in the daytime for fear
of the harpoon that had been thrown at him once
or twice. Then it came into his head that the
lovely nymph was in some mysterious way held
captive by these human creatures. He swore to
deliver her if it cost him his life, for which he
cared only as it could serve his goddess, for that
she was a goddess he fully believed.</p>
<p>He swam in the wake of the ship, and it was
very seldom that he could come up and look his
idol in the face. The sailors kept a sharp look-out
for him. They thought he was some sort of
monster, the poor innocent merman, and had harpoons
ready to throw at him whenever he showed
himself. But for all this he followed The Sea-nymph
across the Atlantic. He knew he was not
likely to meet any of his own people, for the merfolk
avoid ships whenever they can, and do not
frequent the highway between the two continents.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>One day, however, he was so possessed with a
desire for the sight of his love that, utterly reckless,
he swam directly before the ship and stretched
out his arms to the wooden image. &ldquo;I am here!
I will die for you!&rdquo; he cried, for he thought she
was suffering in her captivity and wanted comfort.
There was a shout from the sailors; one flung a
fish spear, another fired a gun. The captain ordered
out the whale-boat, and they gave chase to
the merman, for such they now saw it was. It
was all that he could do to get away. He was a
very fast swimmer, however, and as he was not
obliged to come up to breathe, they soon lost sight
of him. He distanced the boat, but he found
when he stopped that the bullet from the gun had
grazed his shoulder, and that he had lost blood
and was suffering pain. &ldquo;It is for her,&rdquo; thought
the merman as he tried to stanch the blood with
his pocket handkerchief.</p>
<p>Just then a huge sperm whale came dashing up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what in the world are you doing here?&rdquo;
said the whale, surprised. &ldquo;Have those wretches
of men been chasing you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the merman, his eyes flashing;
&ldquo;you may well call them wretches. Do you know
who it is they hold prisoner in their hateful ship?
The loveliest sea-nymph in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; said the whale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen her. I have followed her all the
way from home. She stands holding out a silver
vase. Every creature in the sea ought to fly to
deliver her. If I was only as big and strong as
you! These men are your enemies as well as mine
and hers. I know how they kill you whales whenever
they can. You can sink that ship if you like
and deliver the goddess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whale was so astonished that he had to go
to the top of the water and blow. &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo;
said he, diving down again, &ldquo;you are under some
strange mistake. That is nothing but wood, that
figure on the ship, as sure as my name is Moby
Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You great stupid creature, where are your
eyes?&rdquo; said the merman in a passion, and yet he
was rather struck by the whale&rsquo;s remarks too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my head,&rdquo; said Moby Dick, &ldquo;and I
shouldn&rsquo;t think yours were. Why they put some
such thing on all the ships&mdash;women, dolphins,
what not. I&rsquo;ve seen dozens of &rsquo;em. I know about
nymphs. I used to read about &rsquo;em in the old
classical dictionary in our school. Every school
of whales of any pretension has one. If she was
a sea goddess, do you suppose she&rsquo;d stand there in
all weathers? Besides, there are no nymphs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t sink the ship?&rdquo; said the merman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not; she&rsquo;s only a merchant ship.
If she was a whaler, I would with pleasure.
I&rsquo;ve done it before now, but that was in self-defence.
I&rsquo;m not going to drown a lot of folks because
you have lost your wits. Come, come, my
young friend, go home to your family. I dare say
your mother don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re out. You are too
tired to swim after that ship, and you are hurt besides.
Let me take you home on my back; I&rsquo;d
just as soon swim your way as any other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merman was a little affected by the whale&rsquo;s
tone of kindness, but he was too much possessed
with his wooden love to accept the offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I must follow her to
the ends of the earth. Something tells me she
will yet be mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose she should be?&rdquo; said Moby Dick.
&ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s only a stick cut and painted. What
would the ladies of your family think if you brought
home a wooden wife?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are blind,&rdquo; said the merman, swimming
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are cracked!&rdquo; the whale shouted after
him, but the merman was already out of hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear! dear!&rdquo; said Moby Dick. &ldquo;What a
pity! If I can find any of the mermen, I&rsquo;ll tell
them about him. He ought not to be left to himself;&rdquo;
and he shook his huge head solemnly and
swam away in an opposite direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small"><i>THE BEWITCHED LOVER.</i></span></h2>
<p>Off to Lisbon went the brig Sea-nymph,
and after her the poor merman. He
stayed there as long as the ship stayed,
hiding under boats and behind timbers, chased
more than once, in danger of his life every hour,
hardly able to get a glimpse of his idol. The
wooden nymph stood straight up in her place,
looking toward the city this time, because her head
happened to be turned that way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Once a priest going across the water in a boat
happened to see him. The priest took him for a
demon, was dreadfully scared, and solemnly cursed
him, as is the fashion of priests when they are
afraid of anything. Besides, such is the approved
mode of dealing with demons in those countries.
The report went abroad that there was an evil
spirit in the harbor. The Spanish and Italian
sailors said innumerable prayers to the saints and
bought little blessed candles. The Yankees and
Englishmen hunted him whenever they could, for
they had a curiosity to see what a live demon was
like. You may imagine what a life it was for the
poor merman. He was almost worn out when
The Sea-nymph weighed anchor and set sail for
Sicily. He followed her, of course, for he was
more possessed than ever.</p>
<p>And yet away down at the bottom of his heart
he had misgivings. When day after day went on
and the nymph stood still in the same place, he
could not help thinking to himself, &ldquo;What if it
should be a wooden image, after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when this thought came into his head he
drove it away, and called himself all the names that
ever were for daring to entertain such a notion
about his goddess. Was she not constant? Did
she not always hold out her vase toward him?
He didn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t think, the poor silly merman,
that it was because he always swam right before
her and she couldn&rsquo;t hold it any other way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>Not far from the Straits of Gibraltar the merman
met his most intimate friend, who had been
looking for him a long time, and had only heard
of him through Moby Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said his friend, &ldquo;I am so
glad to see you!&rdquo; and then he stopped, for
he couldn&rsquo;t help seeing that the other was not
at all glad to see him, and he felt hurt and disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; said the merman, coldly, and
gazing after the ship sailing away from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course. We&rsquo;ve all been so anxious
about you. Why haven&rsquo;t you written? Your
grandfather has tried every spell he could think
of, but it all seemed of no use. The dear old
gentleman is almost sick, and so miserable about
you that he has had no heart to finish his work,
even though the Baltic merman has come out with
another pamphlet. Do come home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now as his friend spoke our merman felt at
once how selfish and ungrateful he had been.
But his passion for his wooden nymph had so
altered his nature that instead of being sorry he
was only angry with himself, and pretended that
he was angry with his friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I am old enough to be my own master,&rdquo;
he said, haughtily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what has come over you?&rdquo; said his
friend. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it was natural I should come
to look for you. If I&rsquo;d been lost, wouldn&rsquo;t you
have tried to find me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merman felt more and more ashamed of
himself and grew crosser and crosser. &ldquo;Excuse
me,&rdquo; he said, coldly, &ldquo;but I have business that
I must attend to. I don&rsquo;t choose to discuss
the subject;&rdquo; and he swam away after The Sea-nymph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look here!&rdquo; said his friend, coming after
him. &ldquo;I must tell you something. I&rsquo;m going to
be married to your youngest sister, and I want you
to come and be best man. The girls are breaking
their hearts about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I dare say,&rdquo; said the merman with a
sneer. He had always been a most affectionate
brother, but now he had no room in his heart for
anything but his wooden image.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a dear little girl next door that
will be glad to see you. She&rsquo;s to be bridesmaid,
of course. It&rsquo;s my belief she likes you. The
sweetest mermaid in the sea, she is, except your
sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s well enough for a mermaid,&rdquo; said the
merman, impatiently, for the ship was going farther
and farther away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you ought to be ashamed of yourself,&rdquo;
said his friend, growing vexed at last. &ldquo;I shall
really think that absurd story of Moby Dick&rsquo;s was
true when he said you were in love with a wooden
statue of a human being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not human,&rdquo; snapped the merman, coloring
scarlet; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a nymph, an immortal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at her,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not worthy to behold her perfections,&rdquo;
said the merman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, a catfish may look at a congressman,&rdquo;
said his friend, quoting a sea proverb. &ldquo;Is she
on board that ship off there? Come on;&rdquo; and
away he went and our merman after him. They
came up with the ship, and there, as usual, stood
the wooden image staring over the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s watching for me,&rdquo; said the merman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>The friend said nothing. He swam round and
round, and looked up at the figure-head through
his eye-glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a goddess?&rdquo; asked our merman, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goddess!&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;My dear fellow,
it&rsquo;s only wood as sure as you are alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No merman shall insult me,&rdquo; said our merman,
in a passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wants to? Do open your eyes, my dear
boy, and see for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do; I see how she looks at me and holds
out her silver vase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll do as much for me,&rdquo; said his friend,
swimming before the ship. Our merman was wild
with rage and jealousy, for he could not help seeing
that she did. He drew his sword (for he wore
one), made of a sword-fish blade, and flew at his
friend. &ldquo;Defend yourself,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;A likely story,
I am going to fight you about a wooden stick. As
for looking at me, she&rsquo;d do the same for any old
turtle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>The merman couldn&rsquo;t but feel that this was true.
But he only grew more angry. He struck his
friend with all his might. There was a dark stain
on the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to fight you,&rdquo; said the other,
turning very pale, &ldquo;for you are <i>her</i> brother, but I
think you&rsquo;ll be very sorry for this some time;&rdquo;
and he turned round and swam away as well as he
could.</p>
<p>Fortunately, after a little he met Moby Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; said the whale in a tone of concern.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much,&rdquo; said the other, for he wouldn&rsquo;t
tell the story.</p>
<p>The whale suspected the truth. He sniffed and
wiped his eyes with his flipper, for he was a soft-hearted
monster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you to a
surgeon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He carried the wounded merman to an old sea-owl
who lived in a cave under the rock of Gibraltar.
The old sea-owl was sitting in his door
reading the newspaper when Moby Dick came rushing
toward him, supporting in his flipper the hurt
merman, who was too faint to swim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;This young gentleman has met with an accident,&rdquo;
said the whale to the sea-owl; &ldquo;I want
you to cure him.&rdquo; The sea-owl laid down his
paper and took off his spectacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What concern is it of yours?&rdquo; said the sea-owl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is none of your business,&rdquo; said Moby
Dick. &ldquo;Take him into the house and take care
of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are weakly sentimental,&rdquo; said the sea-owl.
&ldquo;I perceive that you belong to the rose-water
class. What is suffering? A mere thrilling
of a certain set of nerves. It creates a sensation
which we call pain. It is disagreeable. Suppose
it is. Are we sent into the world only to enjoy
ourselves? Enjoyment is contemptible; the desire
of happiness is base, unworthy a rational being.
Let us rise to more exalted feelings; let us
glorify ourselves in discomfort; and if we see any
one basely comfortable, let us make ourselves as
disagreeable as possible, and raise him to our own
platform. What possible difference does it make
whether we live or die, or are cold and hungry?
What odds does it make in this huge universe?
Are we nothing but vultures screaming for prey?
Let us cultivate silence, that I may have the talk
all to myself;&rdquo; and the sea-owl looked at Moby
Dick in the most impressive and superior manner.
&ldquo;What difference, I repeat, does our happiness or
misery make in the huge sum of the universal&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; said Moby Dick, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t
quit talking and tend to this young man, I&rsquo;ll swallow
you. I don&rsquo;t know as that will make much
difference in the universe, but it&rsquo;ll make a sight
of difference to <i>you</i>;&rdquo; and the whale opened his
tremendous jaws wide and showed all his teeth.</p>
<p>The sea-owl took the merman into his office on
the instant. He bound up his wound and attended
him very carefully, for he was by no means such a
fool as you would imagine from his conversation.
The merman was cured before long, and made the
sea-owl a handsome return for his services. The
owl was just as much pleased as though the money
had been a large item in the sum of the universe.
He gave the merman a present of his own poems
neatly bound in shark skin. He had several hundred
copies in his office, for he had issued them at
his own expense. They had been much praised,
but some way they did not sell. The sea-owl said
it was because all the people in the sea were &ldquo;Philistines.&rdquo;
No one knew just what he meant, but
when he called people by that name most all of
them experienced a sort of crushed feeling, and
pretended to admire the poems. Sometimes they
would even buy them, but not often. Moby Dick
accompanied the young merman home, and they
made up a story that his hurt had been caused by
a sword-fish, against whom he had run in the dark.
Nobody believed him, for some way every one
knew the truth, but all the members of the family&rsquo;s
own circle pretended to believe the tale, for they
were all very high-bred people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>It had been intended that the wedding of the
professor&rsquo;s granddaughter should be a very brilliant
affair, but they felt so unhappy about the
grandson that they resolved to invite only a few
intimate friends. Moby Dick, of course, was
among the number. He was too huge to come
into the house, but he put his nose to the window
and ate ice cream with a fire shovel for a spoon.
The beautiful mermaid from next door was bridesmaid,
and looked most lovely. She seemed in
better spirits than any one else, and never said a
word about her old playmate. Toward the end
of the evening she went out into the garden that
was all glittering with sea phosphorescence. She
swam up to Moby Dick and said it was warm
weather.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;So it is, my dear,&rdquo; said the whale, and looking
with admiration at the bridesmaid, who wore
white lace and emeralds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came from Gibraltar, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said
the mermaid, playing with her looking-glass, which
the sea ladies carry as ours do their fans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, where the bridegroom and I went to see
after that bewitched brother-in-law of his,&rdquo; said
the whale, for he was vexed at the merman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he is bewitched?&rdquo; said the
bridesmaid.</p>
<p>The whale scratched his head, which is not vulgar
in a whale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of it before,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but
now you speak of it I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it was
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bridesmaid whispered in the whale&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d come with me to the old Witch
of the Sea,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you, please?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the ends of the ocean with you,
miss, if you want me to,&rdquo; said Moby Dick; &ldquo;but
what for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the bridesmaid, looking straight
in the eye which happened to be that side of the
whale&rsquo;s head, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a friend of the family, you
know. I&rsquo;m very much attached to the girls and
very fond of the professor. I should like to help
them if I could, and I think the witch is a wise
woman, and it wouldn&rsquo;t do at all for the professor
to go to her in his position, but it won&rsquo;t make any
difference to me and you. Will you come now?
It isn&rsquo;t far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; said the whale. &ldquo;Just sit
on my head, and I&rsquo;ll take you there in no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the bride&rsquo;s sister came out into the
garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going, dear?&rdquo; she said to the bridesmaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I shall. Mr. Dick will see me
home,&rdquo; said the other mermaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been rather forlorn,&rdquo; sighed the bride&rsquo;s
sister. &ldquo;To think of his loving a wooden thing!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he had a right to if he chose,&rdquo; said
the mermaid a little hastily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s nothing
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bride&rsquo;s sister was not angry at all. She
kissed her friend good-night, and when she and
Dick had gone sat down and cried a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor dear!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Moby Dick and the bridesmaid were
on their way to the old Witch of the Sea. She
lived in a cave in a thick dark grove of seaweed.
She was sitting before the door talking with a gossip
of hers, one of the Salem witches, whose broomstick
would carry her through the water as well
as through the air. The broomstick, which was
a spirited young one, was standing hitched at the
door, impatiently stamping its stick part on the
ground and switching the broom part about to
keep off the little crabs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; said the Salem witch. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a
dainty young maiden indeed! I&rsquo;m a great mind
to stick a few pins in her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better hadn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Moby Dick, grimly,
for he was not at all afraid of witches. &ldquo;Ask the
old lady any questions you like, my dear; nothing
shall hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p086.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="774" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;Ho! ho!&rsquo; said the Salem witch. &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a dainty young maiden indeed!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you would be so good,&rdquo; said the mermaid,
taking off her jeweled necklace and zone and holding
them out to the witches, &ldquo;will you tell me
where the professor&rsquo;s grandson is, and whether he
cannot be induced to come home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s your interest in <i>him</i>?&rdquo; said the
Witch of the Sea, taking snuff and looking at her
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am his sister&rsquo;s friend,&rdquo; said the mermaid,
steadily; &ldquo;otherwise it is not a matter of consequence
to me whether he spends his life in the
chase of a wooden image; but I am very fond of
the professor, and I think it a very sad thing that
he should be left alone in his old age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; said the Salem witch. &ldquo;Just the
same, fish-tailed or two-legged, in the sea or out
of it. There&rsquo;s a girl in our town as like her as
two peas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young lady,&rdquo; said the Witch of the Sea, &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t had any hand in this matter.&rdquo; (But of
course I can&rsquo;t say this was true. I incline myself
to think she had had her finger in the pie.) &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t undo the spell&mdash;not now. If you want to
find your friend&rsquo;s brother, you must go West toward
the coast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take a bee line,&rdquo; said the Salem witch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that is,&rdquo; said the mermaid,
who didn&rsquo;t know what a bee was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the crow flies,&rdquo; said the Salem witch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crow?&rdquo; said the mermaid, perplexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the mackerel swims,&rdquo; said the sea witch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; said the mermaid. &ldquo;Thank you
very much. Pray keep the stones. Good-night;&rdquo;
and she turned to Moby Dick. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go with
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said the whale. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather
a dangerous coast for me,&rdquo; he thought to himself.
&ldquo;But never mind; if they come after me I can
sink a whaler as easy as nothing. I&rsquo;ll go with her.
She reminds me of a whaless I used to go to school
with;&rdquo; and Moby Dick looked at the little slim
mermaid in her bridesmaid&rsquo;s dress, and heaved a
sigh about a quarter of an acre in extent. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
your whale,&rdquo; he said, cheerfully; and away they
dashed at the rate of a hundred miles an hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p class="tb">Every one in the sea knew that the professor&rsquo;s
grandson had fallen in love with a wooden image,
and was following it about the world. The very
porpoises talked about it to each other. The
whole family were dreadfully mortified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose he marries her!&rdquo; said his sisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never can take her into society. A real
human being would be bad enough, but a wooden
one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I disown him,&rdquo; said the old mer professor.
&ldquo;I desire that no one will mention him in my
hearing. If he would only come home, the poor
dear boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was universal sympathy with the family.
The very sophomores behaved like gentlemen for
as much as a week, they were so touched with the
old mer professor&rsquo;s trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small"><i>THE SEA-NYMPHS.</i></span></h2>
<p>After his friend had left him, our merman
swam once more after The Sea-nymph.
He felt wicked, ashamed, remorseful
and very miserable, but for all that he
followed his wooden goddess. He was so worn
out with his long journeying and with trouble of
mind that he could not keep up with the ship&mdash;he
who had once beaten a fin-back whale in a race.
He had lost sight of the brig before she went into
the harbor of Syracuse, but he knew where she
was going, and he followed in her track. It was
a beautiful moonlit night. The water was all
golden ripples. The ruins of the ancient town
stood up white, still and solemn in the flood of
silver light. The modern city did not look dirty
as it does by sunlight, but white and cool and still.
Only a bell rung at intervals from the tower of a
convent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>On a fragment of a broken capital that lay in
the water near the island shore of Ortyggia sat
three lovely ladies. They looked young and beautiful
as the day, but they were very, very old.
They had known the place before the first Greek
ship bore the first Greek colonists to Sicily. The
broken capital was the last bit of a temple that had
been reared in their honor ages ago, for these were
the real sea-nymphs. They had come back from
the unknown countries where they went when men
forgot them, and the monks shattered their beautiful
marble statues to replace them with waxen virgins
dressed in tinsel. They were taking a journey
just to see what sort of a place this world had
grown to be. They were all three rather low-spirited&mdash;as
much so as sea-nymphs can be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all so different,&rdquo; said Arethusa. &ldquo;It
was hardly sadder in the great siege; I could
hardly find the place where my fountain was
once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;And nothing of Alpheus?&rdquo; said Cymodoce
with a little smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank Heaven!&rdquo; said Arethusa; &ldquo;the
stream is there, but it has another name. I wonder
what has become of the old gentleman? My
dears, you can&rsquo;t think what a torment he was. I
really don&rsquo;t know what I should have done but for
Diana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you would have married him,&rdquo; said
Panope. &ldquo;He was very devoted to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; said Arethusa. &ldquo;He was determined
to have his own way, but he didn&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sing something,&rdquo; said Cymodoce. &ldquo;What
concerts we used to have on this very shore! Oh
dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arethusa began to sing. I only wish you had
been there to hear her.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Years ago when the world was young,</p>
<p class="t">And this weary time was yet to be,</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The shepherd came down to the cool seashore,</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Low in the sky the red moon hung,</p>
<p class="t">The wind went wandering wild and free;</p>

</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Come up, my love,&rsquo; he called, &lsquo;oh come!</p>

<div class="verse">

</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Yet oh, my lover, by this right hand,</p>
<p class="t">It was fate, not I, that was false to thee;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>As Arethusa finished her song, the merman came
swimming wearily toward the three nymphs. If
he had been a human being, he would not have
seen them, but as it was they were revealed to his
eyes. He knew what they were in a moment.
They were dressed like his wooden nymph, and
Arethusa carried a little silver vase in her hand,
but they were not like the figure-head, for they
had sweet, kind faces, and could laugh and cry.
The merman made a most respectful bow, for he
knew how to do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Panope, kindly, &ldquo;can we do anything
for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely nymphs,&rdquo; said the merman, &ldquo;have
you seen a ship pass this way with one of your
fair sisters on its prow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of <i>our</i> sisters?&rdquo; said Arethusa, a little
haughtily. &ldquo;That seems very unlikely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you she is, my lady,&rdquo; said the merman,
reverently but firmly. &ldquo;She has her name,
The Sea-nymph, written below her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has lost his wits,&rdquo; said Panope, sighing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity! Such a handsome youth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that wooden figure-head?&rdquo;
cried Arethusa.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;Surely she is your sister,&rdquo; said the merman,
looking at Cymodoce, who was more like the
wooden nymph than the other two, and whose
manners were always a little stiff and prim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister!&rdquo; cried Cymodoce, quite bristling.
&ldquo;Am I related to a log of wood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Arethusa slyly pinched Panope behind
Cymodoce&rsquo;s back, for the truth was Cymodoce
had once been a wooden ship, and had been made
into a nymph to save her from a conflagration.
She never would allow, however, that this was a
true story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course there is nothing wooden about
you, dear,&rdquo; said Panope, soothingly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
be vexed. Let us help the poor boy if we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very like a Triton I used to know,&rdquo; said
Arethusa, aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a ship pass,&rdquo; said Panope, looking down
at him with her kind blue eyes. &ldquo;Such a big
ship! Not like the ones I used to see here years
ago, and it certainly had a wooden statue on the
prow, but it was only a wooden image; it was not
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;How strange it is,&rdquo; thought the merman to
himself, &ldquo;that these three goddesses should be
jealous of my beauty&mdash;just like three mortal mermaids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jealous of that stick indeed!&rdquo; cried Cymodoce,
answering his thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men!&rdquo; said Arethusa. &ldquo;Panope, my darling,
they are just the creatures they always were in the
water or out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it seems,&rdquo; said Panope, playing in the sand
with her little pink toes like a mortal girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you, sir,&rdquo; said Cymodoce, gravely,
&ldquo;that you are under a serious mistake. That
figure is a mere painted figure-head, quite incapable
of a rational thought or instructive conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we admire in woman is her affections,
not her intellect,&rdquo; said the merman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at me!&rdquo; said Arethusa; and the tall
nymph stood up before him in all her immortal
beauty and shook down her golden hair till it
swept her ankles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Arethusa,&rdquo; said Cymodoce, &ldquo;let me
ask you to consider if this is quite proper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Panope only smiled, and Arethusa took no sort
of notice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and compare me
with that wooden thing. Don&rsquo;t you see the difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A difference there certainly was. The merman
felt a cold chill go to his heart. For one instant
his eyes were opened; for one instant he knew he
had been worshiping a stick. Then he would <i>not</i>
see or feel the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; he cried, desperately; &ldquo;I will
follow her to the ends of the earth, whether she is
alive or not;&rdquo; and he swam away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; said Arethusa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks a good deal like the pious &AElig;neas,&rdquo;
said Cymodoce, who often mentioned that gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; said Panope, almost sharply.
&ldquo;He may be a goose, but he is not a prig. I do
wish you ever could talk about any one else, Cymodoce!
I am tired to death of the pious &AElig;neas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; said Arethusa; &ldquo;he was a humbug
if ever there was one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an expression!&rdquo; said Cymodoce.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Arethusa; &ldquo;suppose we
do this poor merman a good turn, and get Aphrodite
to make his wooden thing a live creature.
Don&rsquo;t you think she would do as much for wood
as she did for marble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could ask her,&rdquo; said Cymodoce. &ldquo;I
have some influence with her. I was so well acquainted
with her son, the pious&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh bother <i>him</i>!&rdquo; said Arethusa, who had been
a mountain nymph originally, and was apt to be a
little brusque.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;d be good for much if she
did come alive,&rdquo; said Panope, looking down.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that match of Pygmalion&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t
turn out very well. I saw the marble woman once.
She was pretty enough, but <i>so</i> stiff, and she walked
as though she weighed a ton, and hadn&rsquo;t a word
to say for herself. And as for this wooden thing,
the woodenness would always remain in her mind
and manners. But we can try. Come, if you
like;&rdquo; and the three slipped into the sea and went
swimming after the merman, but he never saw
them. He had caught sight of his wooden goddess,
and had no eyes for the real ones. He
thought he had never seen his idol looking so
beautiful, so lifelike. &ldquo;<i>She</i> wood!&rdquo; he thought
as he leaned back in the water and looked up in
her face. Meanwhile, some strange influence was
at work upon the wooden image. A kind of
thrill ran over it. It began slowly to breathe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; thought the wooden creature, for
it could think a little now. &ldquo;I must be coming
alive! How very disagreeable! I can see&mdash;even
feel. I don&rsquo;t like it. It&rsquo;s too much trouble. What
is that thing in the sea staring at me?&rdquo; and she actually
bent her head and looked down.</p>
<p>The merman, of course, was in ecstasies, for he
thought she was coming to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly am growing alive,&rdquo; thought the
wooden thing. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t come alive; I was made
wood, and wood I&rsquo;ll stay; I won&rsquo;t go out of my
sphere; I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not proper;&rdquo; and she stiffened
herself as stiff as she could. &ldquo;I will be
wood,&rdquo; she thought, and wood she was, for even
a goddess can&rsquo;t make a thing alive against its own
will. &ldquo;Yes, this is much the best way,&rdquo; was the
wooden image&rsquo;s last thought, as the breath of life
went away from her and left her more wooden
than ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let it go, the stupid thing,&rdquo; said Arethusa in
a pet which was scarcely reasonable, as the image
was wood in its nature. &ldquo;Come, my dears, let
us go from a world where no one cares for our
gifts. Don&rsquo;t cry, Panope dear. There are just
as many fools in the world as ever there were, for
all they pretend to be so much wiser.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is strange too,&rdquo; said Cymodoce, &ldquo;considering
how long they have had before them the example
of the pious &AElig;neas&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> never lost sight of his interest,&rdquo; said Panope.
&ldquo;I wish we could persuade that poor merman,
but I know very well that the twelve great
gods couldn&rsquo;t do it;&rdquo; and the three vanished and
were seen no more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p class="tb">That night there came up a terrible storm.
There was wind and rain and thunder such as
the merman had never heard. From far away
came a thick sulphurous cloud of smoke, and in
the air was a dull red glare. The land shook and
trembled, for &AElig;tna was feeding his hidden fires,
filling his inmost furnaces. The gale blew fiercely
from land. The Sea-nymph snapped her cable,
and drove out of the harbor before the tempest.
The merman followed her. By the glare of the
lightning he could see that the figure stood in its
old place holding out her silver vase. &ldquo;What
wonderful courage!&rdquo; he thought, for he did not
know it was nailed there. The masts went crashing
into the sea. The sailors threw overboard
everything they could to lighten the ship. One
of them sprang forward with an axe and began to
cut away the figure-head. The merman swam,
balancing himself on the crest of the waves; every
one was too busy to notice him; he could not
hear the blows of the axe in the noise of the wind
and thunder; he did not see what the sailor was
doing; he saw the image quiver under the strokes
of the axe, and thought that at last she was coming
down to him. &ldquo;Oh come, come,&rdquo; he cried,
swimming directly below and holding out his
arms. The wooden image quivered and shook;
it bent forward; the next instant the solid heavy
oak fell with a plunge and struck the poor merman
in its fall. He felt that he was dying, but he did
not know what had hurt him. &ldquo;My own love,
my sea-nymph,&rdquo; he murmured; and he put his
arms round the figure-head that was bobbing up
and down in the sea quite unconcernedly. He
kissed the painted lips. Then at length he knew
that his idolized nymph, for whom he had given
his life, was nothing but a carved log. It was well
for him that his next breath was his last.</p>

<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small"><i>LUCY PEABODY&rsquo;S DREAM.</i></span></h2>
<p>Moby Dick went on his way, &ldquo;emerging
strong against the tide.&rdquo; A Nantucket
ship saw him as he blew, and her boats
put out after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just get off a minute, my dear,&rdquo; said he to
the little mermaid whom he carried. She did so,
and then, instead of swimming away from the boats,
he put down his enormous head and went straight
at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white whale!&rdquo; cried the sailors; and they
did not throw the harpoon, but went meekly back
to the ship. They were bold enough, but they
were afraid of the white whale, for Moby Dick
had sunk two or three ships in his time and entirely
reversed the whalers&rsquo; programme.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Moby Dick executed a huge frisk on the surface
of the sea, flapped his tail on the water with a
noise like thunder, and then dived down to rejoin
the mermaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, my dear,&rdquo; he said, cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you are safe,&rdquo; said the mermaid,
patting him with her little hands.</p>
<p>On they went through the water, and the coast
was soon in sight. It was growing dusk, and the
lighthouse showed its red star over the sea. The
mermaid was silent, and Moby Dick did not trouble
her to talk.</p>
<p>Suddenly a beautiful woman appeared to them
on the crest of a long rolling billow. She made
no effort; she did not swim, but moved through
the water by her will alone. She seemed a part
of the sea, like a wave come alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not a human being, surely,&rdquo; said the
mermaid, startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very like that&mdash;you know&mdash;that wooden
thing&mdash;that <i>he</i> ran after,&rdquo; said Moby Dick in a
gigantic whisper, &ldquo;only it&rsquo;s alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She don&rsquo;t seem as though she could ever have
been wood,&rdquo; said the mermaid. &ldquo;She looks kind.
I don&rsquo;t feel as though she were that&mdash;that person.
Please ask if she has seen our friend.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; my dear child,&rdquo; said Panope&mdash;for she it
was&mdash;answering the mermaid&rsquo;s thought, &ldquo;I have
seen him;&rdquo; and the immortal sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His family are very anxious about him, my
lady,&rdquo; said the whale, who was conscious of an
awe he had never known before, though he felt he
could trust the Sea-Nymph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They need be anxious no more,&rdquo; said Panope,
gently and sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; asked the mermaid,
turning pale, but keeping herself very quiet.</p>
<p>Panope went to her, and the immortal daughter
of the sea put her white arms round the mermaid
and held her in a close and soft embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, very gently, &ldquo;your old
playmate is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p104.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="779" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; she said, very gently, &lsquo;your old playmate is dead.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; said Moby Dick,
with a great sigh; and then he swam away to a
little distance and left the mermaid to the care of
the Sea-Nymph, for he was a whale of very delicate
feelings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>The mermaid looked into the blue eyes of the
Goddess, and felt that the countless ages of her
being had but made her more wise and kind. She
hid her face on the immortal maiden&rsquo;s bosom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sweet child,&rdquo; said Panope, after a little
while, &ldquo;I cannot bring your friend to life&mdash;it is
beyond my power&mdash;but if you will, I can give you
an immortality like my own. I can carry you with
me to a world where death or pain has never come,
and keep you young and lovely for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mermaid was silent a moment. Then she
looked up into Panope&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not be angry with me?&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angry, my poor darling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, my friends that I have loved have all
been mortal. My mother is dead, my twin brother
was killed in the war, and now my old companion&mdash;and
I have known him so long! I think
I should rather not be so very different, but go to
them when my time comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Panope caressed her hair with a soft hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but you are right. Sometimes,&rdquo;
said the Goddess, with a sad, tired look in her eyes,
&ldquo;I think I would be glad to be mortal myself,
except that I am glad to be a little comfort to you.
I am sorry I came back. Either the world has
grown a sad place, or else I had forgotten what it
used to be. But I don&rsquo;t know; I almost broke
my heart over Prometheus when I was quite a
young thing. I could have helped him take care
of his beloved human race a great deal better than
Asia, but he never cared anything for me. It is
all over long ago. Is there nothing that I can do
for you, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mermaid was silent a minute. Then she
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I should like to take him home to his
friends. I know they would wish it should be so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be,&rdquo; said Panope. &ldquo;Wait here, and
I will bring him to you. But, my dear child, you
are so quiet. All the mortal women I ever knew
in the old days, in the sea or out, would have torn
their hair and screamed, but you are so different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mermaid looked up with a little ghost of a
smile, half proud, half pitiful. &ldquo;I suppose it is
because I was born in American waters,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait but a little,&rdquo; said Panope. &ldquo;The whale
will take care of you. He is a good creature.
His great-grandfathers were pets of mine long ago.
I will soon come back again;&rdquo; and the Nymph
was gone.</p>
<p class="tb">Some time after the news had come to Salem of
the total loss of the brig Sea-nymph, Lucy Peabody
was walking alone along the sands. She felt
weary, and sat down under the shadow of a rock
to rest. The sun was just setting, the west was
suffused with a golden glow, the water lay, hardly
rippling to a low whispering wind, a sea of fire
and glass. Lucy leaned her head against the
rock, and sitting there, she dreamed a dream.
Along the sands toward her came old Goody
Cobb, whom everybody suspected of witchcraft.
She appeared so suddenly that Lucy in her dream
thought she had come out of the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; said Goody Cobb, with a cracked
laugh; &ldquo;so here is Madam Peabody&rsquo;s lady daughter
come out to cry over her disappointment all by
herself? The man was a fool, sure enough, but I
wouldn&rsquo;t mind. Just let me write your name
down in a little book I keep, and you shall see
our fine young madam dwine away like snow in
spring-time, and then we shall see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are out of your mind, Goody,&rdquo; said Lucy
in her dream; &ldquo;but such talk as that is not safe,
for there are those in town who are silly enough to
believe witch stories, and you might get yourself
into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly, are they!&rdquo; cried Goody Cobb, growing
angry. &ldquo;But never mind. Just let me have your
name, and we shall see what we shall see. Look
at the pretty necklace I will give you;&rdquo; and she
drew from her pocket a chain of shining green
stones and held it up before the girl&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have nothing to say to you or your
gifts,&rdquo; said Lucy, steadily. &ldquo;Pass on your way,
Goody, and leave me alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think yourself too good for me!&rdquo; said
the witch in a rage. &ldquo;Let me tell you that my
family is as good as yours, and better. My grandfather
was a minister&mdash;ay, and a noted one&mdash;while
yours was selling clams round the streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a very odd thing that while Goody Cobb
had become a witch, renounced her baptism and
sold herself to the enemy of mankind, she was yet
very proud of the eminent divine, her grandfather.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be the death of you! I&rsquo;ll stick pins in
you, and set my imps to pinch you black and
blue!&rdquo; screamed Goody Cobb, with the look of a
possessed woman, as she was.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as Lucy dreamed&mdash;so suddenly that
she seemed to grow out of the air&mdash;there stood on
the sand between herself and the witch a tall and
beautiful woman in shining raiment of green and
silver, with golden hair that fell loosely to her
ankles. She gazed sternly on the witch; a divine
wrath made her blue eyes awful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You earth-born creature!&rdquo; she cried as she
caught the green necklace from the old woman&rsquo;s
trembling hand. &ldquo;This girl is a child of the
ocean, and is in my care;&rdquo; and Lucy dreamed
that she felt glad to remember how she had been
born on the voyage her mother made with her
father to Calcutta. &ldquo;Stay where you are for
ever!&rdquo; continued the stranger lady, raising her
white hand with a gesture of command. &ldquo;You
will wreck no more ships&mdash;you, nor your sister
witch.&rdquo; And then as she stood Goody Cobb stiffened
into stone and became a black rock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;You need not be afraid of me, my dear,&rdquo; said
the dream lady to Lucy. &ldquo;I never hurt any one
in my life. I am only an innocent Sea-Nymph,
and I am&mdash;or I was&mdash;the helper of all the sailor-folk,
and your father is a bold seaman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucy dreamed that she was very much surprised,
which was curious, for in a dream the more remarkable
a thing is, the less it astonishes the
dreamer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought there never were any nymphs,&rdquo;
she said, perplexed.</p>
<p>The sea-maiden smiled a queer little smile&mdash;half
sad, half amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that since men left
off believing in them and building temples, the
gods all declare that there never were such things
as human creatures, and that it was all a delusion
of ours? Keep this;&rdquo; and she dropped the necklace
into Lucy&rsquo;s lap. &ldquo;It belonged to one who
will not care to wear it now. Farewell;&rdquo; and
the goddess bent down and lightly kissed the girl&rsquo;s
forehead, and the next instant Lucy was alone.
She woke up, as she thought, and sat still for a
moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a singular dream!&rdquo; she said to herself.
Then she looked round, and saw a black rock
standing beside her, &ldquo;Was that rock there? I
don&rsquo;t remember it, but of course it must have
been.&rdquo; She rose to her feet. Something fell glittering
on the sand. She picked it up. It was a
long, shining necklace of green stones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is very strange!&rdquo; said Lucy, thoughtfully.
&ldquo;But I suppose I had better take them home.
They must have been washed up from the sea and
caught to my gown some way. How pretty they
are! I wonder if they belonged to some one who
is drowned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put the necklace into her pocket, and turned
to go home. She had gone but a little way when
she met Job Chippit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Job,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have found something
on the sand. Do you think any one in town
has lost it, or that it was washed up by the sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Job examined closely the emerald necklace.
&ldquo;This never belonged to anyone in our town,
Lucy,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;most likely the tide washed it
up in the last storm. Yours it is by all right if no
one comes to claim it; and be keerful of it, for I
expect it&rsquo;s awful valuable. But what&rsquo;s happened
to you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got an odd look about you, some way,
but I never see you look so pretty. Has anything
happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lucy, quietly, &ldquo;only I sat down to
rest and fell asleep, and had a very strange dream.
Good-night, Uncle Job.&rdquo; From that evening
Goody Cobb was never seen in Salem town.</p>
<p>Job Chippit continued his walk, thoughtfully
whittling a little stick. Before long he overtook
Master Isaac Torrey, who was walking along the
shore with his head down, seeming to notice nothing
but the sand at his feet. Master Torrey had
quite left off his wild ways. He made no more
foolish, fanciful speeches about nymphs and goddesses,
and such nonsense. &ldquo;Anna Jane had
made a sensible man of him,&rdquo; said his father-in-law.
&ldquo;He was greatly improved,&rdquo; said every
one, with the exception of Ichabod Sterns and Job
Chippit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Master Torrey had avoided the wood-carver
since his marriage. His father-in-law thought it
a good sign. &ldquo;He had been quite too familiar
with that person,&rdquo; thought the colonel. But this
night Master Torrey did not avoid him, though he
only nodded without speaking in answer to Job&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Good-evening,&rdquo; and then the two walked on in
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an odd-looking thing on the beach,&rdquo;
said Job at last.</p>
<p>They went up to the dark mass Job had pointed
out. There on a heap of weed, thrown up by the
late storm, lay the wooden nymph, the paint almost
washed away, and there, with its arms tightly
clasped about her neck, lay a strange creature,
half fish, half human.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As sure as the world, it&rsquo;s a merman!&rdquo; said
Job; &ldquo;and there really are such critters, after all!
Poor fellow! The human part of him was pretty
good-lookin&rsquo; when he was alive. See what a
dent he&rsquo;s got in his head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is the figure-head of The Sea-nymph,&rdquo;
said Master Torrey. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure! Well, it does beat all! What
shall we do with the merman? I&rsquo;d kind of hate
to make a show of him. He&rsquo;s a sort of man, and
I &rsquo;spose he had his feelings anyhow. Look at the
empty scabbard and the sword-belt; and he&rsquo;s got
a ring on his finger.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Job bent down and tried to unfold the dead
hand from its close clasp. At that moment,
though it was very calm, a huge wave rose from
the sea, and came thundering up the beach, covering
the two men with spray. When it retreated
the dead merman and the figure-head were gone,
and up from the sea came a low sobbing sound.</p>
<p>Master Torrey and Job stood watching, surprised
and startled. Another minute, and up
came a second huge wave, bearing upon its crest
the oaken sea-nymph. On it rolled&mdash;a mountain
of water. It dashed its burden upon the jagged
rocks once, twice, thrice, and strewed the shattered
fragments over sea and sand. Job drew a long
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waal,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there goes the best piece
of wood I ever chipped. Tell ye what, philosophy
won&rsquo;t explain everything. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t best to be too
rational if you want to have any insight into things
in <i>this</i> world. If that wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t done a-purpose, I
never see a thing done so!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>They turned back and walked toward the town.
Far away in the offing a whale sent up an enormous
jet, a sea-gull screamed wildly above their
heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to say anything about this?&rdquo; said Job
at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would be the use?&rdquo; said Master Torrey,
sharply. &ldquo;Half of them would not believe you;
and who wants to set all the fools in the place
chattering?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I! I&rsquo;m not over-fond of answering questions.
I&rsquo;d rather ask &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Job. &ldquo;Do you
know, putting this and that together, and the
story of the queer fish that hung round the ship,
I&rsquo;ve got a notion that poor fishy thing fell in love
with that figger-head of ourn? You couldn&rsquo;t expect
such a critter as he was to have more sense
than a landsman, and I expect the log fell on him
when the brig went to pieces and killed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better for him if he had given
his soul to a wooden image,&rdquo; said Master Torrey,
bitterly. &ldquo;Good-night;&rdquo; and he left Job and
walked slowly back to his handsome new house.
Job looked after him wistfully. Just then old
Ichabod came up and saluted the wood-carver.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Ichabod,&rdquo; said Job, &ldquo;that
Master Torrey and I just found the figure-head of
the poor Sea-nymph, all shattered to bits on the
rocks? The waves brought her all this way to
smash her at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish they had smashed her at first,&rdquo; said
Ichabod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Job, with a curious look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Ichabod, &ldquo;she was an unlucky
creature from the first. She was too much
alive for a wooden image, and too wooden to be a
live woman, much less a goddess.&rdquo;</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
